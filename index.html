<h1>Eurosplaining for American Noobs.</h1>
<p>This is the chronicle of my ongoing adventures in onboarding my American peers into the world of Eurovision. It's a high-level highlight of primarily contemporary Eurivision songs and events, heavily biased to my personal tastes, and interests and almost certainly contains at least a couple of unintentional errors.</p>

<p>My goal with these articles is to show the fun of Eurovision while helping Americans move past the "LOL this is weird" stage responsible for work such as:</p>

<p>And into a "Hell yes, this is weird!" stage of more profound Eurovision understanding.</p>
